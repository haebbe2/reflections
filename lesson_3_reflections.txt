When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If different people work on the same project; if I work with different computers on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- If I am currently changing a file that is changed in the repository manual merges may be often necessary; no control, what version I want to have on my system

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- Being able to easily compare the versions without net access?
